# Day 26 â€” CSS Basics: selectors, colors, backgrounds, units


**Files:** `index.html`, `styles.css`


What I practiced today:
- CSS selectors: element, class, id, descendant, attribute selectors, pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements.
- Colors: using CSS variables (custom properties) to keep a consistent palette.
- Backgrounds: linear gradients and how to swap to image backgrounds.
- Units: `px`, `rem`, `em`, `%`, `vw`, `vh`, and responsive functions like `clamp()`.


Try these next:
- Add a `:focus` style for accessibility on form inputs and links.
- Swap the color palette and test contrast with a tool.
- Replace the gradient with a background image and learn `background-size` and `background-position`.
